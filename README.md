Repository: Create a uniquely named GitHub repository (e.g., Audi-BMW-Auto-Garage).
GitHub Pages: Deploy the application on GitHub Pages for easy access.
README: Include a project description, list of technologies, screenshots, and a link to the live site.
2. UI Design with CSS Framework
Framework: Choose a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Bulma for styling.
Responsive Layout: Use the framework’s grid system to make the layout adjust well on any device.
Polished Look: Design a simple, clean interface with clear labels and good spacing for a professional appearance.
3. Core Functionalities
User Info Input:
Add fields for first and last names with real-time validation to ensure proper input.
Car Models Display:

Add a prominent "Schedule" button to submit the form.

Load this data on page reloads to show the user’s last scheduled appointment.

JavaScript for Form and Modal Handling: Use JavaScript for form validation, saving input, and showing the confirmation modal.
Real-Time Feedback: Provide immediate feedback to users for validation errors and successful scheduling.
